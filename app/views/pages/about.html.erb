<h1>About Balor // Reflection</h1>
<div id="about">
  <p>When I entered high school I knew I was interested in technology. I&#x27;d dabbled with my family&#x27;s mac and learned a few tricks and shortcuts in using my computer, but I had never really gotten deeply involved in its inner workings. After joining the techies I realized that computers were really &quot;my thing&quot; and started to improve my knowledge about them. I picked up web design relatively quickly and began working with html and css to create simple web pages.</p>
  <p>By the time I reached the end of my junior year I had mastered html and was quite good with css. I&#x27;d begun to dabble in web programming language, namely php and a little bit of ruby. When it came time to choose my culminating project my path was clear, I&#x27;d do something with web application development. At the time I had been playing in a couple of Dungeons and Dragons games and hated dealing with paper character sheets. I&#x27;d hacked together a couple of solutions with php, but they were very fragile and depended heavily on my ability to maintain poorly written php code. I mixed these two hobbies to create my project.</p>
  <p>I&#x27;d been looking for an excuse to force myself to learn Ruby on Rails, and starting this project proved to be the perfect catalyst. I began working early in the summer and managed pretty steady progress throughout the duration of the project. Working with Rails was never a chore and, though sometimes frustrating,  always fun. I felt almost as though I had cheated by working steadily when many of my friends started freaking out when the deadlines loomed and I wasn&#x27;t stressed at all. The only stressful part of the project has been setting up meeting times, the actual work has always been refreshing and interesting.</p>
  <p>I&#x27;ve learned many valuable skills throughout this project, mainly the obvious ones such as a far better understanding of ruby and rails, but also general design practices and server configuration. The best thing I have acquired from this project, however, is a new sense of freedom. Now, whenever I think of an application I&#x27;d like, I can just write it myself. No longer do I have to deal with sub-par applications, or ones that don&#x27;t do quite what I&#x27;m looking for. I kept running into instances where I would think of an idea for a project but have to put it on hold so I could finish Balor.</p>
